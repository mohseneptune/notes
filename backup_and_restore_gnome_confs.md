# Backup and Restore Guide for GNOME Terminal and Shortcut Keys

## Backup Instructions

### 1. GNOME Terminal Settings Backup

To back up your GNOME Terminal settings, you'll use `dconf` to export your settings to a file.

**Steps:**

- Open a terminal window.
- Run the following command to export your terminal settings:

  ```sh
  dconf dump /org/gnome/terminal/ > gnome-terminal-settings-backup.dconf
  ```
  
- This command creates a file named `gnome-terminal-settings-backup.dconf` with all your terminal settings.

### 2. GNOME Keyboard Shortcuts Backup

Keyboard shortcuts in GNOME are also saved via `dconf`. You'll export them to a file as well.

**Steps:**

- Still in the terminal, run the following command to export your custom keyboard shortcuts:

  ```sh
  dconf dump /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/ > gnome-keyboard-shortcuts-backup.dconf
  dconf dump /org/gnome/desktop/wm/keybindings/ >> gnome-keyboard-shortcuts-backup.dconf
  ```
  
- This will create or append to a file named `gnome-keyboard-shortcuts-backup.dconf` containing your keyboard shortcuts.

### 3. Transfer to USB Drive

- Connect your USB flash drive to your computer.
- Copy the backup files to the USB drive by using the file manager or running the following commands:

  ```sh
  cp gnome-terminal-settings-backup.dconf /path/to/usb/drive
  cp gnome-keyboard-shortcuts-backup.dconf /path/to/usb/drive
  ```

- Replace `/path/to/usb/drive` with the actual mount point of your USB flash drive.

- Safely eject the USB drive from your laptop after the copy process is complete.

## Restore Instructions

### 1. Preparing the Files

- Connect the USB flash drive to the destination PC.
- Mount the USB drive and locate the backup files. Note the path to these files.

### 2. GNOME Terminal Settings Restore

- Open a terminal on the destination PC.
- Run the following command to restore your terminal settings from the backup file:

  ```sh
  dconf load /org/gnome/terminal/ < /path/to/usb/drive/gnome-terminal-settings-backup.dconf
  ```

### 3. GNOME Keyboard Shortcuts Restore

- In the same terminal, run the following commands to restore your keyboard shortcuts:

  ```sh
  dconf load /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/ < /path/to/usb/drive/gnome-keyboard-shortcuts-backup.dconf
  dconf load /org/gnome/desktop/wm/keybindings/ < /path/to/usb/drive/gnome-keyboard-shortcuts-backup.dconf
  ```

### 4. Verifying the Restore

- Verify that the GNOME Terminal settings have been applied by opening the Terminal and checking the preferences.
- Verify the keyboard shortcuts by going to the GNOME Settings and reviewing the Keyboard Shortcuts section.

### 5. Troubleshooting

If settings are not applied after the restore process, log out and log back in, or reboot your system. If certain settings still donâ€™t work, check for conflicts or discrepancies between the systems and adjust manually if necessary.
