### Domain-Driven Design Layers

**Presentation Layer:** The Presentation Layer is the outermost layer of the application and serves as the entry point for external interactions. It handles user input and external requests, shaping responses to be presented to the user. This layer includes components like Controllers for handling HTTP requests and Consumers for interacting with external messaging systems. It's also responsible for sending information to the outside world through Controllers and Producer classes. While this layer focuses on interaction with the outside world, it's worth noting that, depending on the application's complexity, it might directly interact with the database or other external systems. The concept of "Persistence Ignorance" is not a strict requirement in this layer, as its main responsibility is interaction and user experience.

**Application Layer:** The Application Layer is where the business process flows are managed. This layer orchestrates the use cases and coordinates interactions between different parts of the system, including the domain layer. Here, domain entities are created and updated to achieve specific use cases. It also handles concerns like transaction management, ensuring that business operations are executed correctly. Additionally, it is responsible for reacting to domain events and executing work commands. The Application Layer focuses on how to execute business processes, and it's not concerned with data storage. However, it should be aware of the domain's structures and services and might call upon them as needed.

**Domain Layer:** The Domain Layer is the core of the application, where all the business rules related to the problem being solved are defined. This layer houses essential domain concepts such as entities, value objects, aggregates, factories, and domain-specific interfaces. It's crucial to keep this layer as independent as possible from external dependencies and third-party libraries, focusing solely on simulating the business processes. The term "Persistence Ignorance" is often applied to this layer, meaning it should not be directly coupled to database or infrastructure concerns. The design of interfaces in the Domain Layer usually pertains to domain services or domain events rather than interfaces used by the infrastructure layer.

**Infrastructure Layer:** The Infrastructure Layer is responsible for interacting with external services and systems such as databases, messaging systems, and email services. In this layer, you will find concrete implementations of the interfaces defined in the Domain Layer. These implementations give identity to the domain interfaces and handle the low-level details of interacting with external services. Additionally, the Infrastructure Layer contains code for communication with the external world, including network operations and file system access. Similar to the Domain Layer, it should focus on how to access data, but it should not include business rules or domain-specific logic. It's important to avoid dependencies on unrelated third-party libraries and keep this layer distinct from the core domain logic.
